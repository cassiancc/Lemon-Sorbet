A Vanilla+ pack focused around living comfortably, building up your world, and reworking some of the more strange decisions of modern Minecraft. Lemon Sorbet's mod list has been carefully cultivated, focusing on mods and content ported or designed with Lemon Sorbet in mind.

Lemon Sorbet's primary goal is consistency. Both Minecraft itself and the included mods have been modified to that end, with the goal of creating one unified experience. **If you experience issues with Lemon Sorbet, please [report them here](https://github.com/cassiancc/Lemon-Sorbet/issues).**

## One World, One Dimension

Lemon Sorbet does away with the Nether and the End, allowing the player to focus on what matters: their builds and experiences in the overworld. To that end, the game has been overhauled.

### The Nether is gone!

Lemon Sorbet welcomes back an old friend - the Nether Reactor. Ruined reactors can be found across the world, allowing players to bring the Nether to them. Fight off the summoned Piglins, then bring your spoils to a reworked Trial Chamber to fight off Infernal Trials.

### The End is gone!

Shulkers are a thing of the past - introducing sacks and improved bundles, alongside a major buff to item stack size, making it possible to carry around more items without shuffling through as many GUIs.

Elytras are out too, in its place are heavily buffed Minecarts and Horses.

### Villagers and Mending are gone!

Without an infinite source of blocks and items localized entirely in a convenient trading hall, players need to think a bit harder about how they want to progress.

Mending has been made unnecessary - any tool can be repaired without requiring experience, and tools can be upgraded directly through crafting so that every piece of gear you make can be _yours_, gradually upgraded as you progress through the game.

### And much, much more!
Naturally integrated coordinates, reworked food mechanics, additional Sniffer content, reworked smithing mechanics, all this and more awaits in Lemon Sorbet! 

## Mods

...and much, much more!
